- Porject CharterMais trkl 
- User manual
- READ.ME

Design : 

- Mock Up

Development : 

- Back end 
- Front End

Human Ressrouces : 

- Unjustified absence time
- Overtime

You can see our project's KPIs  following [this link](https://algosup-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/robin_goumy/EYrk5Cafv1dMgymb8nSp5esBLqcweLlJSfQut3MZREPwcA?e=f8d4bO).

###  Risks & Assumptions

# Risks and Assumptions

| ID  | Description | Consequence | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation/Avoidance |
|-----|------------|------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| 1   | Synchronizing the timing simulation with the 2D FPGA visualization may be difficult. | May lead to incorrect or non-intuitive visual representation. | High | Medium | Implement careful testing and debugging mechanisms. |
| 2   | Users (teachers/students) may have different levels of expertise with FPGA and Verilog. | Some users might struggle with using the tool effectively. | Medium | High | Provide comprehensive documentation |
| 3  | Teachers may struggle to prepare and upload new FPGA examples. | Limits the usability of the tool. | Medium | High | Develop a simple and well-documented process for adding new examples. |



### Mood

The mood inside the team is calculate base on the different aspect : 
- Motivation
- Management 
- Productivity
- Communcation


This is a simple average of the various categories, taking into account team size, number of responses and category evaluation.

This average is currently :  ðŸŒŸ
