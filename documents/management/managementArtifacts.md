## Key Performance Indicators

To follow the progress of the project, multiple KPIs have been defined. They can be viewed through our KPIs spreadsheet.

Our KPIs have been separated into different categories as follows:

Documents: 

- Project Charter
- Functional Specifications
- Technical Specifications
- Test Cases
- Test Plan
- Management Artifacts
- User Manual
- READ.ME

Design: 

- Mock-up

Development: 

- Back-end 
- Front-end

Human Resources: 

- Unjustified Absence Time
- Overtime

You can see our project's KPIs following [this link](https://algosup-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/robin_goumy/EYrk5Cafv1dMgymb8nSp5esBLqcweLlJSfQut3MZREPwcA?e=f8d4bO).

##  Risks & Assumptions

| ID  | Description                                                                             | Consequence                                                                         | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation/Avoidance                                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Synchronizing the timing simulation with the 2D FPGA visualization may be difficult.    | May lead to incorrect or non-intuitive visual representation.                       | High   | Medium     | Implement careful testing and debugging mechanisms.                   |
| 2   | Users (teachers/students) may have different levels of expertise with FPGA and Verilog. | Some users might struggle with using the tool effectively.                          | Medium | High       | Provide comprehensive documentation.                                  |
| 3   | Teachers may struggle to prepare and upload new FPGA examples.                          | Limits the usability of the tool.                                                   | Medium | High       | Develop a simple and well-documented process for adding new examples. |

## Mood

The mood inside the team is calculated based on the different aspects:
- Motivation
- Management 
- Productivity
- Communication

This is a simple average of the various categories, taking into account team size, number of responses and category evaluation.

This average is currently: 7.5 ðŸŒŸ
