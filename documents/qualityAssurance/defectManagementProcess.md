# Defect Management Process

## 1. Defect Identification

- **Objective**: Detect and report defects during various stages of the software development lifecycle.
- **Tools**: Use GitHub Issues to log defects.

## 2. Defect Logging

- **Details to Include**:
  - Defect ID
  - Summary
  - Description
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Severity and priority
  - Environment details
  - Screenshots or logs (if applicable)
  - Reporter information

## 3. Defect Triage

- **Objective**: Review and prioritize defects based on their severity, impact, and urgency.
- **Participants**: Developers, testers, project managers.
- **Actions**: Assign labels, set priorities, and schedule for resolution.

## 4. Defect Assignment

- **Objective**: Assign the defect to the appropriate developer or team for resolution.
- **Tools**: Use GitHub Issues to assign defects.

## 5. Defect Resolution

- **Objective**: Fix the defect by making necessary code changes.
- **Actions**:
  - Developers work on the issue.
  - Link commits to the issue.
  - Perform unit testing to ensure the fix is effective.

## 6. Defect Verification

- **Objective**: Re-test the defect to confirm that it has been resolved and that the fix did not introduce new issues.
- **Participants**: Testing team or original reporter.
- **Actions**: Execute relevant test cases and update the issue status.

## 7. Defect Closure

- **Objective**: Close the defect in the tracking system once it has been verified and no further action is required.
- **Actions**: Update the issue status to closed.

## 8. Defect Reporting and Metrics

- **Objective**: Generate reports and metrics to analyze defect trends and provide insights to stakeholders.
- **Tools**: Use GitHub Insights or third-party tools for advanced reporting.
- **Metrics**: Defect density, defect aging, defect resolution time.

## 9. Continuous Improvement

- **Objective**: Use insights gained from defect metrics to improve development and testing processes.
- **Actions**: Conduct retrospectives, update processes, and implement best practices.

## Additional Considerations

- **Workflow Customization**: Define and document your defect management workflow, including states, transitions, and responsibilities.
- **Test Case Management**: Integrate a test management tool for handling test cases.
- **Automated Testing**: Plan your CI/CD pipeline and integrate automated testing tools.
- **Risk Management**: Document and track risks separately.
- **Resource Management**: Use project management tools to plan and track resource allocation.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation in a dedicated system and link relevant documentation to issues.

By following this defect management process, you can ensure that defects are systematically addressed and resolved, maintaining the quality and reliability of the software.
