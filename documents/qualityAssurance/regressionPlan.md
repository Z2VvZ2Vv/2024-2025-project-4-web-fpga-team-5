## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the regression testing approach to validate that recent code changes do not introduce defects in existing functionalities. It ensures application stability, performance, and compliance with business requirements before deployment.

### 1.2 Scope

Regression testing covers:

- **Core Functionalities:** Core modules, workflows, and use cases.
- **Feature Updates & Bug Fixes:** Areas impacted by code modifications.
- **System Integrations:** External services, APIs, and dependencies.
- **Performance & Security:** Validation of speed, load handling, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines.

## 2. Test Strategy

- A stable test environment is available.

**Exit Criteria:**

- No Critical or High-severity defects remain open.
- Automated and manual tests have passed with acceptable defect rates.
- Test reports are reviewed and approved by QA leads.

| **Unit Tests**                  | Verify individual functions and methods            |
| **Integration Tests**           | Validate interactions between modules and services |
| **System Tests**                | Ensure system stability with real-world workflows  |
| **User Acceptance Tests (UAT)** | Business users validate feature readiness          |
| **Accessibility Tests**         | Verify compliance with WCAG standards              |
