# Web FPGA - Team 5

This repository held a visualization of a FPGA simulation.

---

## Definition

This project involves creating a web-based interface for an FPGA simulator that visually demonstrates how signals propagate within an FPGA. It is designed to serve as an educational tool. Our goal is to help users understand FPGA internals by merging a 2D floorplan view of the FPGA (showing its basic elements and the interconnections between them) with a dynamic simulation of signal timing.

## Tests

This section will explain how to run the end to end tests created by the quality assurance of the team. \
We assume that you are at the root of the project and that Node.JS is already installed. \
If not you can fork the project at [this link](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-4-web-fpga-team-5/fork) and install Node.JS at [this one](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

To test the front-end:

```shell
# Move to the correct folder
cd frontend/

# Dependencies installation
npm i

# Execute the test suites
npm run test:e2e
```

To test the back-end:

```shell
# Move to the correct folder
cd backend/

# Dependencies installation
