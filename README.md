# Web FPGA - SPIN

This repository held a tool to visualize an FPGA simulation.

---

## Definition

This project involves creating a web-based interface for an FPGA simulator that visually demonstrates how signals propagate within an FPGA. It is designed to serve as an educational tool. Our goal is to help users understand FPGA internals by merging a 2D floorplan view of the FPGA (showing its basic elements and the interconnections between them) with a dynamic simulation of signal timing.

## Status

This project is currently in progress. However, after 2025/04/01, our team will be focusing on another project, which is why the frequency of updates will be greatly diminished. \
Therefore, if you are willing to keep going on this project, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) part.

## Usage

### How To Visualize An Example

1. Click on Visualize.

2. Click on the desired example.

A new page with the visualization of the example should open.

> [!NOTE]
> On the visualization page, you can:
>
> - Zoom In/Zoom Out
> - Move around
> - Fullscreen

---

### How To Create A New Example

1. Click on Create.

2. Click on the name text box, then, enter your example name.

3. Click on Add Example, then, select the wanted files.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also drag and drop them directly inside the section.

4. Click on the Create button.

You can now refer to the [How To Visualize An Example](#how-to-visualize-an-example) section to visualize your example again.
