# Web FPGA - Team 5

This project involves creating a web-based interface for an FPGA simulator that visually demonstrates how signals propagate within an FPGA. It is designed to serve as an educational tool. Our goal is to help users understand FPGA internals by merging a 2D floorplan view of the FPGA (showing its basic elements and the interconnections between them) with a dynamic simulation of signal timing.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need. 

```shell
commands here
```

what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With

List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Api Reference

In this section you'll be provided with the link to [api documentation](here)
